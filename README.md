FINALLY! A SOCIAL APP FOR BOOK LOVERS! [XYLA](https://xyla-books.herokuapp.com/) is my latest APP making adventure in software engineering! My intent is to bring a social experience to the book loving world because they have no place to do this as is. Sure they can mix in with the muddled facebook or instagram experience, but this experience is tailored for them. Being able to create a bookshelf, make direct recommendations to friends, see their posts, and eventually make book clubs will be an experience that hasn't yet existed in this way. A true wave of the book loving future. How is this possible, you ask?...

### **TECHNOLOGIES** 
**NODEJS**, **EXPRESS**, **MONGODB**, **MONGOOSE**, **REACT**, **HEROKU**, **AFFINITY DESIGNER**, and **TRELLO** were all used in this creation. NodeJS allows programmers to utilize Javascript on the server, express is the web framework that helps setup / maintain the organization of the **MVC**   (MODEL/VIEW/CONTROLLER) design pattern, and the Mongoose library helps with interacting and creating databases in MongoDB! Their powers combined with **HTML & CSS** are the basis   creating just about anything for the world wide web. While those technologies are the foundation for building a web APP, adding **REACT** into te mix can really push things over the edge. React makes iterating through and rendering sets of data easy, clean, concise, and opens up the 

Special thanks to [GOOGLE BOOKS API](https://developers.google.com/books) for use of their API and **HEROKU** for deployment of my app! ([TRELLO](https://trello.com/b/9D8Ym3Nm/xyla) was used as an organization tool for implementing each step of the process. By creating boards to plan user stories (AAU - as a user:) and move those stories from "ice-box" to "implementation" to "completion")

### **GETTING STARTED** 

1. You can acces my [TRELLO BOARD](https://trello.com/b/9D8Ym3Nm/xyla) to see project organization, thought process, and ERD Diagram for mapping database relationships.
2. And use this link: [XYLA](https://xyla-books.herokuapp.com/) to access the deployed app.
3. Enter the app w/ TOKEN BASED AUTHENTICATION 
4. Search via google.books API for books to add to your bookshelf.
5. Make posts that will be visible in a public feed.
6. Make recommendations to friends with books in your library!
7. Find other friends / users to see their posts!


### ICEBOX:

Down the road I would consider other feature sets that would be a nice addition:
1. Ability to create groups, add members, create events for those groups, and have group chats.
2. Create personal security settings to be able to add friends.. where only friends can view your information.
3. Add business accounts for professionals in the book industry that would like to be able to gain followers and post material that attracts business.
4. Ability for users to follow business accounts for their updates.
